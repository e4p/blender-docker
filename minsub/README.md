# What is minsub

`minsub` is a library for programatically launching Pipelines on
the Google Cloud Genomics Pipelines V2alpha1 API. `minsub` is
partially drived from the [dsub](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/dsub)
tool and partially new. Minsub is _not_ intended to be a dsub
replacement but instead is meant to be a Python wrapper and
helper for the Google Cloud Genomics Pipelines API.

is noted in the file's header. All other modules are original
for minsub and thus are covered by this repository's MIT
